# data-structures-and-algorithms

A repository to study about data structures and algorithms. Things I would like to practice:

- Using functional programming concepts with Scala and Kotlin
- Persistent data structures
- Traditional data structures

Learning resources:

- [Functional Programming with Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala#:~:text=Functional%20Programming%20in%20Scala%20is,%2C%20concise%2C%20and%20clear%20progression.)
- [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1)
- [A common sense guide to data structures and algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Guide-Structures-Algorithms-Second/dp/1680507222)
