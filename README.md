# data-structures-and-algorithms

A repository to study about data structures and algorithms. Things I would like to practice:

- Using functional programming concepts with Scala and Kotlin
- Persistent data structures
  - Immutable Linked List
  - Immutable Set
- Traditional data structures
  - Linked list
  - Stack
  - Queue
  - Trees
    - Binary Search Tree
    - Retrieval Trees (a.k.a Tries, I really dislike this name)
  - Graphs
    - Djikstra's algorithm
